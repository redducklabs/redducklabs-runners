## üß™ Validation Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation

#### 1.1 Dockerfile Integrity Check ‚úÖ
```bash
# Syntax validation
docker buildx build -f docker/Dockerfile.custom-runner --check .
```
**Status:** PASSED - No warnings found

#### 1.2 Tool Version Alignment ‚úÖ
```bash
# Verify test scripts match Dockerfile versions
grep -n "3.18" docker/Dockerfile.custom-runner test/verify-tools.sh
```
**Status:** PASSED - Helm version aligned to 3.18.6

#### 1.3 Security Documentation Review ‚úÖ
- CVE-2025-8959 documented with remediation details
- References to security fixes included
- Verification procedures documented

### Phase 2: Build Validation

#### 2.1 Image Build Test
```bash
# Build test image
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.custom-runner -t redducklabs/runner:security-test .
```
**Expected:** Successful build with all security updates

#### 2.2 Security Tool Functionality
```bash
# Test critical security tools in built image
docker run --rm redducklabs/runner:security-test trivy --version
docker run --rm redducklabs/runner:security-test kubesec version
docker run --rm redducklabs/runner:security-test helm version
```
**Expected:** All tools respond with correct versions

### Phase 3: Deployment Validation

#### 3.1 Runner Deployment Test
```bash
# Deploy updated runners
cd deploy && ./deploy.sh
```
**Expected:** Successful deployment with new image

#### 3.2 Tool Verification
```bash
# Run comprehensive tool verification
./test/verify-tools.sh
```
**Expected:** All 20+ tools verified successfully

#### 3.3 Security Fix Verification
```bash
# Run security-specific validation
./test/verify-security-fixes.sh
```
**Expected:** CVE-2025-8959 verification passes

### Phase 4: Production Validation

#### 4.1 Workflow Execution Test
- Run representative GitHub Actions workflow
- Verify security tools function in CI context
- Confirm no regression in runner functionality

#### 4.2 Security Scanning
```bash
# Scan deployed runner image
trivy image registry.digitalocean.com/redducklabs/github-runner:latest
```
**Expected:** No HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities for fixed CVEs

#### 4.3 Runtime Security Check
- Verify container security contexts
- Confirm non-root user execution
- Test resource limits and constraints
